# Top 5 Articles List 
1. [Effects of Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the Development and Fecundity of an Aphid Pest](http://www.co2science.org/articles/V24/feb/a3.php)
    * This article argued that rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels reduces the impacts of aphids on wheat and also helps with wheat production. 
    * The authors used a scientific paper, plus several of their data points to support their claim, as well as mentioning that Navarro et. al also stated that rising CO2 levels could help in wheat production. 

2. [Three Decades of Mangrove Forest Biomass Change in NSW, Australia](http://www.co2science.org/articles/V23/apr/a10.php)
    * This article argues that rising CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature levels are actually good for the Mangrove forest system, based on an analysis of increasing above ground biomass and root mass. 
    * In this case, they used something that was partly true to prove their point,without acknowledging that temperatures past 4 degrees would cause intense stress, leading to decreased plant growth and survival, and eliminating any potential benefits (Tigchelaar et al., 2018). 

3. [Increasing Hurricane Intensity Study Fatally Flawed](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/increasing-hurricane-intensity-study-fatally-flawed/)
    * In this article, they argue that the increasingly severe hurricanes that have occurred since the 1990s were not caused by climate change but due to the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) cold phase between 1979-1995. 
    * The authors used NASA’s statement about AMO’s impact on hurricanes to support their claims, while disregarding the other information in the article explaining why hurricane intensity is on the rise. 

4. [Overview: ‘Ocean Acidification](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/23/overview-ocean-acidification/)
    * This article argues that ocean acidification is not occurring due to the fact that they are good buffer systems and that this is instead normal seasonal variation in pH levels. 
    * The authors are downplaying the extent of ocean acidification and referencing potential causes for smaller shells in coccolithophorids, such as temperature, as well as using “reputable” papers to support their claim. 

5. [Study Shows Arctic Sea Ice Reached Lowest Point On Modern Record… In The 1940s, Not Today!](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/24/study-shows-arctic-sea-ice-reached-lowest-point-on-modern-record-in-the-1940s-not-today/) 
    * This article analyzed sea ice thickness during pre-industrial, historical , and modern times to determine how much of the ice melted, and found the greatest decrease in 1940. 
    * The author conducted their own research using wavelet analysis to prove their point with data collected from reputable sources, an extensive list of scientific articles, and relevant diagrams. 

# Evaluation of "Effects of Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the Development and Fecundity of an Aphid Pest"

This article argues for the positive impacts of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on the development and performance of bird cherry-oat aphids, a common cereal pest (CO2 Science, 2021). The article author's overall argument was that since increased CO2 levels interferes with aphid development and proliferation, while also increasing wheat crop yields, higher CO2 levels are actually beneficial for humans (CO2 Science, 2021). This article is of interest because globally, pests are responsible for destroying around 30-40% of crops harvested annually, and expensive and harmful pesticides are required to treat them (Carreras Navarro, Lam and Trębicki, 2020). However, in contrast to the conclusions present in the article, any benefits of increased CO2 levels for plant and pest treatment are negated by other climate change effects. 
This article is not credible. The author of this article works at CO2 Science who have a clear goal — convincing their audience that rising CO2 levels are not important. None of the articles written by CO2 officials had a specific author to check the credentials of. The article also had only one reference, from the paper they analyzed; however, they twisted the information to suit their stance and ignored facts that refuted their claims. This source is heavily opinionated, biased, and has a clear social agenda of discounting climate change, and, as such, this is not a good information source.  
While it is true that rising CO2 levels can lead to increased crop yields there are several issues with their statement. They fail to mention that climate change can cause volatile temperature changes, drought and flooding, and rising sea levels (Thompson, 2010). Increased rainfall can damage vulnerable crops, and increasing temperature mean that plants require more water, which is another financial burden for farmers (Tigchelaar et al., 2018). Research also indicates that temperature increases greater than four degrees Celsius, there will be a rapid drop in overall crop production (Tigchelaar et al., 2018). It also presents additional problems as it can increase weed growth and the presence of other pests which would result in greater pesticide use and increased expenses for farmers (Cho, 2018). While elevated CO2 can increase photosynthesis which in turn increases wheats biomass, it is also linked to decreased nutritional value (Carreras Navarro, Lam and Trębicki, 2020). They also found that wheat grown under elevated CO2 has decreased nutritional value. Specifically, it decreases the amount of nitrogen, proteins, and free amino acids available (Carreras Navarro, Lam and Trębicki, 2020).  All of this is evidence that the article employs hasty generalization as a logical fallacy.  
However, despite increased CO2 levels, the actual increase in development time from birth to adulthood for aphids was not significant, going from 6.29 days to 6.86 days (Carreras Navarro, Lam and Trębicki, 2020). In the presence of higher nitrogen, pests became more prolific, reproducing faster and developing more quickly, something they neglected to talk about in their review (Carreras Navarro, Lam and Trębicki, 2020). As well, aphids prefer plant tissue with higher sucrose levels, which occurs in plants grown with higher CO2 levels which may cause aphids to target these plants more. As population numbers continue to climb, food security is more important than small benefits that occur due to rising CO2 levels. The nutrient poor plants which are produced by increased CO2 levels also influences the growth and development of the aphids, meaning that CO2 is not responsible for the slower development but rather the nutrient poor sap of the plants (Sun and Ge, 2011). They also ignored the conclusion of the paper they reviewed, that nitrogen did not have a significant impact on aphid development rather than CO2. Finally, the impact of CO2 will not selectively affect aphids, other helpful insects will also be harmed (Carreras Navarro, Lam and Trębicki, 2020). 

 

# Common Themes between Articles 
In all the mentioned articles, they twisted information from reputable sources to fit their stance in an attempt to appeal to authority and legitimize their claims, while ignoring facts that contradict their position and hyperfixate on any information that could support it they reach a hasty generalization of the problem. Many articles ignore scientific evidence by stating that models are unreliable, or that colder winters proves global warming isn’t occurring, or that it is a natural process that humans have no part in. In contrast, another common stance is that global warming is actually good, it will increase crop yields or that longer summers are preferable. In all cases, the articles repeat arguments that have already been debunked.
