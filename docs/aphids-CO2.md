# Evaluation of "Analysis: Hurricanes Have Not Gotten More Intense, Frequent Over Past 170 Years"

The argument made in this article is that hurricane frequency and intensity has not increased over the past 170 years (Gosselin, 2021). This claim is particularly interesting as other sources including the IPP report of 2013 as well as the National Climate Association oppose this idea and have claimed that hurricane frequency and severity is increasing over time. This article was written by Pierre Gosselin, who claims to have an Associate Degree in Civil Engineering and a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Additionally, this article was posted on Pierre’s blog ‘NoTricksZone’, which has no government or corporate backing. Pierre appears to have a strong bias that humans are driving climate change, and that the climate is not changing, the media is portraying natural disasters as a result of changing climate rather than existing, naturally occurring events. Pierre’s lack of relevant educational background, the non-peer-reviewed nature of his blog, and his clear bias make this article standout as an unreputable source. However, in this article Pierre cites a peer-reviewed journal article published in Nature to back his stance. This paper by Knutson et al. (2008) which claims to show a simulated reduction in Atlantic hurricane frequency under twenty first century warming conditions using computer modelling systems. Although the authors claimed this as their finding, there is a lot of room for error within the paper that could influence this. Firstly, the Knutson et al. article only found a simulated reduction in frequency, not intensity. In fact, the simulations even showed an increase in intensity, as well as a large in increase in frequency of major hurricane counts. Specifically, the simulation used in the article found a decrease in tropical storm and hurricane frequency driven by greenhouse gas. Upon taking a closer look at the only source Pierre used in his article, it is clear parts of the Knutson article were taken out of context in a form of confirmation bias for him to use in his blog. Furthermore, there are many reputable sources such as the third National Climate Assessment report and the 2013 IPCC report, which are written and reviewed by scientists with relevant backgrounds, state that hurricane intensity and frequency are increasing (Melillo et al., 2014; IPCC, 2013). Upon analyzing all the facts in Pierre’s article as well as doing more research in other resources, it is clear that Pierre’s climate claim is false.
